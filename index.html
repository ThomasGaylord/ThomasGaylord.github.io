    <h1>Test Site</h1>
    <p>This is an example site based on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files">MDN Dealing with files</a> documentaion.</p>
    <p>There is no 'backend' for this site (database or serverside scripting) -- it's a static site.</p>
    <p>The important thing to notice here is source code and the directory structure for this site. You will want to download and unzip the test-site folder, and veiw the contents in a file manager like Microsoft Windows File Explorer or Apple's Finder for Mac. Look at the files in an editor like VSCode. Upload and publish (host) the site on a server like GitHub Pages, or the CSCI 331 course server.</p>

    <h2>Notice this HTML file is named index.html</h2>
    <p>That's a special name. It's the "homepage," or default page that loads into the browser.</p>
    <p>Other HTML pages in the site will have unique names.</p>
